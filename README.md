**Alison Melville's Shiatsu** needs a B2C website that showcases a massage business specialising in Shin Tai near Manchester. I designed the site to educate the user about the benefits of Shiatsu Shin Tai and allow them to contact her to book a consultation. 
I created the site to look professional and in keeping with the theme of similar Shiatsu websites and using the colour schemes to bring a relaxing impression as would be expected with a massage site.
The goal of the website will be to interact with existing and potential clients and be a source of information to educate them, build confidence and encourage them to contact the business owner.
The site must contain all information required to complete these goals.
Site visitors will most likely be comparing with other similar services in the local area so must stand out and show everything the user would want to see.

## **Design Choices**

### **Fonts**

I have chosen [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open+sans) for the headers and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) for the rest of the text on the site (eg. paragraphs and lists)

### **Colours**

![Coolors Palette](assets/images/ms1-ali.png)
Format: ![Coolors Palette](https://coolors.co/80a1d4-45b0ae-75c9c8-b8aec1-c0b9dd-f7f4ea-f5f9fd)
and rgba(245, 244, 244, 0.8) for the Jumbotron.

These colours compliment each other well and are not too striking, in keeping with what the user expects of a massage site.

## **Features**

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### **Features Implemented**

- Feature one is a section with a description of Shiatsu which educates users to the basics of Shiatsu massage.
- Feature two is a section about the specific Shin Tai massage which allows users to understand more about the subject, origin and health benefits.
- Feature three is a section about the business owner and masseuse, Ali, including qualifications and an image of her for users to relate to. 
- Feature four is a list of recent testimonials so that the user can identify how other users have benefitted from the service.
- Feature five is a section about what to expect during the service including a youtube video tutorial.
- Feature six is a Google Map location so that the users can find the area and compare to where they are located.
- Feature seven is a contact page where the user can communicate with the business owner by filling out a form.

### **Future Features**
- Later I would like to implement an appointment booking system and for the user to receive feedback of appointment booked via email and sms.
- I would also like to add an option for the user to add a testimonial to the business online.

## **Version Control**

**Version control** was managed within **GitHub** and **Gitpod** and regular commits pushed to **GitHub**.

### Gitpod Workspaces
1. Starting from GitHub clone the [Code Institute template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) by clicking Use This Template and copying to my repository under the name ms1-ali-shiatsu. The workspace is then launched by clicking GitPod - this action only needs to be performed once and then workspace reopened from GitPod.
2. Start the Gitpod Workspace which opens an **online IDE editor** window.

### Update GitHub by committing from GitPod
3. After each change made I would save the code, perform *git add .*, *git commit -m "commit message here"* and *git push* to push my changes to the GitHub repository. 
4. Meaningful commit messages were used to allow to roll back any changes made throughout the journey.

After beginning this process I acknowledged that using git branches would be a more efficient way to do this to avoid any bugs in the future.

## **Testing**

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

## **Bugs**

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
