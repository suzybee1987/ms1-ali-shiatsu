# Alison Melville's Shiatsu Massage

![](assets/images/amiresponsive.png)

## About
**Alison Melville's Shiatsu** needs a B2C website that showcases a massage business specialising in Shin Tai near Manchester. I designed the site to educate the user about the benefits of Shiatsu Shin Tai and allow them to contact her to book a consultation. 
I created the site to look professional and in keeping with the theme of similar Shiatsu websites and using the colour schemes to bring a relaxing impression as would be expected with a massage site.
The goal of the website will be to interact with existing and potential clients and be a source of information to educate them, build confidence and encourage them to contact the business owner.
The site must contain all information required to complete these goals and site visitors will most likely be comparing with other similar services in the local area so must stand out and show everything the user would want to see.

## **Design Choices**


### **Fonts**

I have chosen [Architect's Daughter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Architects+Daughter) for the headers as it is easy to read and has sufficient contrast to the main body font. It is a cursive font so has a more easy-going, relaxed look inkeeping with the feel of the site. 
![assets/images/architects-daughter.png]

and [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) for the rest of the text on the site (eg. paragraphs and lists) as it is easy to read with wider spacing than other fonts.

![assets/images/montserrat.png]


### **Colours**

As the site purpose is about relaxation and massage the colour scheme used is adapted to suit with what the user would expect of this kind of site. It features complementary blue, green and purple colours that also stand out to make the content easy to read. The colours chosen are:

![Coolors Palette](assets/images/ms1-coolors.png.png)
Format: [Coolors Palette](https://coolors.co/5b76a0-299491-45b0ae-827aa2-f5f9fd)

These colours compliment each other well and are not too striking, in keeping with what the user expects. 

### **Imagery**


Images can be found in [assets](assets/images) and feature Shin Tai massages being performed, a profile of the business owner and continue with the relaxing theme of the site.

## **Features**

### **Features Implemented**

Features relevant to both pages:
- **Header**
  - Contains the navigation links and is fixed to the top of the page for easy use on all devices (this was done using Bootstrap sticky-top class).
  - All links are underlined when hovered over and for the icons this is done using the border-bottom attribute to provide spacing and prevent overlapping the icon.
  - The headings are underlined as the user visits different areas of the page (using Bootstrap scroll-spy) to help the user work out where they are in the page.
  - The home button is on the left of the header and sections of the page listed on the right where a user would expect them to be.
  - Navigation links are underlined when the user hovers over them to give feedback that they have hovered over the right spot.
  - On mobile and tablet view the Navigation links collapse in to a toggle button for easier user experience. Some JavaScript was used here to ensure the menu closes after a link is pressed to avoid the user having to close the menu. 
  - The colour scheme is designed to be easy to read with the contrast and the ratio tested on Google Dev Tools.

- **Hero sections**
  - The image takes up the full width of the browser to leave a high impact lasting impression with the user and this is replicated on both pages to bring a sense of familiarity when browsing.
  - The hero images were obtained when searching for massage related images to instantly give the user the confirmation that this is the site they were searching for.
  
 - **Footer** 
  - Designed to sit at the bottom of the page after all of the content 
  - Contains social media links and a link to Shiatsu Society website so that the user can verify the business owners professional status. 

  
*index.html*
  
- **About sections**
  - About Shiatsu and About Shin Tai sections contain some information which allows users to understand more about the subject, origin and health benefits.
  - About Me section gives the user some history about how the business owner discovered Shin Tai and confidence in her registered status along with a portrait of her for them to relate to.
  - On mobile and tablet view the About Shin Tai and About Me sections have been condensed using Bootstrap Accordian component to prevent the user from having to scroll through large volumes of text. The information is split in to subheadings to allow the user to target the information they require. 

- **Pricing and Services section**
  - Provides a video showing the massage being performed by the developer of Shin Tai to allow the user to understand what to expect.

- **Testimonials**
  - Bootstrap cards used here to contain the testimonial quotes - featured on browser are three cards but to save space on mobile and tablet this has been reduced to one. 

*contact.html*

- **Contact form**
  - For the user to contact the business owner, the fields: Name, Phone and Email and required and show error messages if not filled before clicking submit. Comments (textarea) is not required. 

- **Modal**
  - This component from Bootstrap's library is used to give feedback that the form has been submitted as without it the form would reset on submission. This required some use of JavaScript to show it only after all required fields have been filled. 

- **Buttons** 
  - On the form the buttons are as a user would expect there is a submit and reset button on the form with the Reset button having more muted colours and Submit button the obvious choice for the user to select upon submission. The modal Close button uses the same colour scheme making it easy for the user to understand what is expected after the message is displayed. 


### **Future Features**
- I would like to implement an appointment booking system and for the user to receive feedback of appointment booked via email and sms.
- I would also like to add an option for the user to add a testimonial to the business online and link to Trust Pilot


### **Responsive Design**

- Bootstrap columns were used to make the site responsive on all devices.

## **Version Control**

**Version control** was managed within **GitHub** and **Gitpod** and regular commits pushed to **GitHub**.

### Gitpod Workspaces
1. Starting from GitHub clone the [Code Institute template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) by clicking Use This Template and copying to my repository under the name ms1-ali-shiatsu. The workspace is then launched by clicking GitPod - this action only needs to be performed once and then workspace reopened from GitPod.
2. Start the Gitpod Workspace which opens an **online IDE editor** window.

### Update GitHub by committing from GitPod
3. After each change made I would save the code, perform *git add .*, *git commit -m "commit message here"* and *git push* to push my changes to the GitHub repository. 
4. Meaningful commit messages were used to allow to roll back any changes made throughout the journey.

After beginning this process I acknowledged that using git branches would be a more efficient way to do this to avoid any bugs in the future.

## **Testing**

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

## **Bugs**

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
