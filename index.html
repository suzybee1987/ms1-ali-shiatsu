                                <p>Originating in Japan and based on Eastern philosophies. Shiatsu is an ancient
                                    non-invasive therapeutic touch that works on the physical, emotional, psychological
                                    and
                                    spiritual aspects of the whole person.
                                    Shiatsu uses the power of touch on acupressure points and gentle stretching
                                    techniques
                                    to contact Ki (energy) that flows in the energetic pathways (meridians) within the
                                    body.
                                    For many reasons the meridians can become blocked and imbalanced, this is when
                                    symptoms
                                    of disease arise. </p>

                                    years ago. Shin Tai emphasises the flow of the the two primary meridians:
                                    the
                                    Governing Vessel (along the spine) and Conception Vessel (up the front of

                                    body).
                                    Together with the Central Channel, these are the core energetic channels
                                    from
                                    where

                                The basic principle is to create space and restore motion. This leads to the
                                recovery of life force (lost energy) in the body. Life force gets trapped in the
                                body from emotional, physical and psychological trauma and everyday stresses thereby
                                creating patterns of behaviour. Shin Tai touches on a very deep level looking to
                                address these underlying energetic patterns that are utilising an individuals energy
                                in ways that do not necessarily support them in the present moment. Shin Tai is a
                                journey of self discovery that enables individuals to have more energy, clarity and
                                begin to make choices in life that brings them the most joy.

                            <p>My journey with Shiatsu began as a result of on-going pain from a whiplash injury
                                received some ten years before. I was a keen yoga and Tai Chi student as this gave
                                me some relief but not on a long term basis. I started to accept the pain and
                                restricted movement within my neck and shoulders until a chance conversation with a
                                Shiatsu Practitioner. After a series of treatments and I began to feel a sense of
                                ease and understanding of my own body and wanted to know more. I knew without a
                                doubt that I wanted to share this bodywork and its benefits with others.</p>

                                    am a registered practitioner with the Shiatsu Society. After graduating I have
                                    continued my professional development, undertaking workshops by leading bodywork
                                    practitioners. In 2013, I began my Shiatsu Shin Tai journey with Kindy Kaur, a
                                    leading teacher of Shin Tai in the UK. Since then I have regularly attended
                                    workshops learning the principles of Shin Tai. I see Shin Tai as a practice to
                                    enable us to get in touch with our own true self and see our own true potential.
                                    My work is now predominately influenced by Shin Tai.

                        <p>The session takes place on a body cushion on a futon at floor level.
                            You will remain fully clothed throughout. Please wear loose and comfortable clothing,
                            ideally long-sleeved t-shirt, jogging trousers and socks.
                            The first session will be slightly longer, 60-75 minutes to enable me to get to know you
                            better and for you to try my work. I will also ask general questions regarding your
                            general
                            health and medical history.
                            Thereafter any follow-up sessions are 60 minutes. During each session, there is time for
                            you
                            to discuss any needs that you may have. Afterwards, there is also space to let the
                            session
                            settle within you before you leave and continue with your day.
                            Please drink plenty and of water before and after the session and take time to relax
                            afterwards.
