              Originating in Japan and based on Eastern philosophies.
              Shiatsu is an ancient non-invasive therapeutic touch that
              works on the physical, emotional, psychological and
              spiritual aspects of the whole person. Shiatsu uses the
              power of touch on acupressure points and gentle stretching
              techniques to contact Ki (energy) that flows in the
              energetic pathways (meridians) within the body. For many
              reasons the meridians can become blocked and imbalanced,
              this is when symptoms of disease arise.

                Shin-Tai is a body of work evolved from Shiatsu developed by Saul Goodman over 40 years ago. Shin
                Tai emphasises the flow of the two primary meridians: the Governing Vessel (along the spine) and
                Conception Vessel (up the front of the body). Together with the Central Channel, these are the core
                energetic channels
                from where the classical meridians develop.</p>
              <p>
                The basic principle is to create space and restore motion and this leads to the recovery of life force
                (lost energy) in the body. Life force gets trapped in the body from emotional, physical and
                psychological trauma and everyday stresses thereby creating patterns of behaviour. Shin Tai touches
                on a very deep level looking to address these underlying energetic patterns that are utilising an
                individual’s energy in ways that do not necessarily support them in the present moment. </p>
              <p>Shin Tai is a journey of self-discovery that enables individuals to have more energy, clarity and begin
                to make
                choices in life that brings them the most joy.

                I work with a variety of Shin Tai techniques which include elements of Shiatsu, fascial unwinding,
                stillness, Central Channel release, passive structural adjustments, Cranio-Sacral techniques, and

              <p>
                My journey with Shiatsu began as a result of on-going pain from a whiplash injury received some ten
                years before. I was a keen yoga and Tai Chi student as this gave me some relief but not on a long-term
                basis. I started to accept the pain and restricted movement within my neck and shoulders until a
                chance conversation with a Shiatsu Practitioner. After a series of treatments and I began to feel a
                sense of ease and understanding of my own body and wanted to know more. I knew without a doubt that I
                wanted to share this bodywork and its benefits with others.
              </p>
              <p>
                I enrolled and graduated from the Shiatsu College, Manchester branch in 2009. I am a registered
                practitioner with the Shiatsu Society. After graduating I have continued my professional development,
                undertaking workshops by leading bodywork practitioners. In 2013, I began my Shiatsu Shin Tai journey
                with Kindy Kaur, a leading teacher of Shin Tai in the UK. Since then I have regularly attended
                workshops learning the principles of Shin Tai. I see Shin Tai as a practice to enable us to get in
                touch with our own true self and see our own true potential. My work is now predominately influenced
                by Shin Tai.

                  <p>I enrolled and graduated from the Shiatsu College, Manchester branch in 2009. I am a registered
                    practitioner with the
                    Shiatsu Society. After graduating I have continued my professional development, undertaking
                    workshops
                    by leading
                    bodywork practitioners. In 2013, I began my Shiatsu Shin Tai journey with Kindy Kaur, a leading
                    teacher of Shin Tai in
                    the UK. Since then I have regularly attended workshops learning the principles of Shin Tai. I see
                    Shin
                    Tai as a practice
                    to enable us to get in touch with our own true self and see our own true potential. My work is now
                    predominately
                    influenced by Shin Tai.

              The session takes place on a body cushion on a futon at floor level and you remain fully clothed
              throughout. Please wear loose and comfortable clothing, ideally a long-sleeved t-shirt, jogging trousers
              and socks. The first
              session will be slightly longer, 60-75 minutes to enable me to get to know you better and for you to try
              my work.</p>
            <p>
              I will
              also ask general questions regarding your general health and medical history. During each session, there
              is time
              for you to discuss any needs that you may have and afterwards there is also space to let the session
              settle within
              you before you leave and continue with your day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please drink plenty and of water before and after the session and take time to relax afterwards.
