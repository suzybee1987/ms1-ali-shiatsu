                        <p>Originating in Japan and based on Eastern philosophies. Shiatsu is an ancient
                            non-invasive therapeutic touch that works on the physical, emotional, psychological and
                            spiritual aspects of the whole person.
                            Shiatsu uses the power of touch on acupressure points and gentle stretching techniques
                            to contact Ki (energy) that flows in the energetic pathways (meridians) within the body.
                            For many reasons the meridians can become blocked and imbalanced, this is when symptoms
                            of disease arise. </p>

                            <p>Shiatsu aims to bring energy to the areas most in need and disperse energy from where it
                                has become blocked. As a result, supporting, strengthening and restoring harmony to the
                                whole body.
                                It is a deeply relaxing experience and regular treatments can alleviate stress, tension
                                and stiffness, help improve breathing and maintain health and general well-being.

                                <p>Shin-Tai is a body of work evolved from Shiatsu developed by Saul Goodman over 40
                                    years ago. Shin Tai emphasises the flow of the the two primary meridians: the
                                    Governing Vessel (along the spine) and Conception Vessel (up the front of the body).
                                    Together with the Central Channel, these are the core energetic channels from where
                                    the classical meridians develop.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The basic principle is to create space and restore motion. This leads to the
                                    recovery of life force (lost energy) in the body. Life force gets trapped in the
                                    body from emotional, physical and psychological trauma and everyday stresses thereby
                                    creating patterns of behaviour. Shin Tai touches on a very deep level looking to
                                    address these underlying energetic patterns that are utilising an individuals energy
                                    in ways that do not necessarily support them in the present moment. Shin Tai is a
                                    journey of self discovery that enables individuals to have more energy, clarity and
                                    begin to make choices in life that brings them the most joy.

                                <p>My journey with Shiatsu began as a result of on-going pain from a whiplash injury
                                    received some ten years before. I was a keen yoga and Tai Chi student as this gave
                                    me some relief but not on a long term basis. I started to accept the pain and
                                    restricted movement within my neck and shoulders until a chance conversation with a
                                    Shiatsu Practitioner. After a series of treatments and I began to feel a sense of
                                    ease and understanding of my own body and wanted to know more. I knew without a
                                    doubt that I wanted to share this bodywork and its benefits with others.</p>

                                    <p>I enrolled and graduated from the Shiatsu College, Manchester branch in 2009. I
                                        am a registered practitioner with the Shiatsu Society. After graduating I have
                                        continued my professional development, undertaking workshops by leading bodywork
                                        practitioners. In 2013, I began my Shiatsu Shin Tai journey with Kindy Kaur, a
                                        leading teacher of Shin Tai in the UK. Since then I have regularly attended
                                        workshops learning the principles of Shin Tai. I see Shin Tai as a practice to
                                        enable us to get in touch with our own true self and see our own true potential.
                                        My work is now predominately influenced by Shin Tai.
